Project Overview
This project is a Scroll Animation Website created using Canva for designing visuals and HTML/CSS/JavaScript to implement smooth, scroll-triggered animations. As users scroll down the page, elements like images, text, and graphics smoothly animate or change in response to the scroll action.

The goal is to provide an engaging, interactive user experience with creative designs, all thanks to Canva for visual assets and smooth animations using CSS and JavaScript.

Features
 * Dynamic Scroll Animations: Elements on the page animate as the user scrolls (e.g., fading in, sliding in, etc.).
 * Canva Design Integration: Beautiful visuals designed with Canva are integrated into the website to enhance the aesthetic appeal.
 *  Responsive Layout: The website is responsive, meaning it works across all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
 * Interactive Experience: Scroll animations make the website feel more engaging and interactive for users.


Technologies Used:

HTML – For creating the structure of the website.
CSS – For styling the website and implementing animations.
JavaScript – For handling the scroll events and triggering animations.
Canva – For creating all visual assets like images, banners, and graphics used in the website.
